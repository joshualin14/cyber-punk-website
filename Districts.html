<h1> Watson</h1>
<body class="district">
<p> a thriving corporate zone, Watson has fallen from grace and is now a gritty, densely populated district filled with immigrants, underground markets, 
and gang activity. Areas like Kabuki and Little China are packed with neon signs, back-alley clinics, and black-market tech.
It's home to gangs like Maelstrom and the Tyger Claws, making it one of the most unpredictable parts of the cityâ€”and where V's journey begins.

<p>
Westbrook is the wealthy, upscale district of Night City.<br> 
It's home to the opulent residences of the corporate elite and features the vibrant, 
neon-drenched streets of Japantown, a cultural hub for the Japanese community.<br>
Westbrook's clean, modern aesthetic and bustling nightlife stand in stark contrast to the rest of the city.
