<h2>Welcome to Night city</h2>
Set in the dystopian Night City in 2077, 
Cyberpunk 2077 paints a grim future where 
powerful megacorporations like Arasaka and 
Militech dominate society, controlling politics, 
technology, and violence,while ordinary people 
struggle to survive in neon-lit streets rife with 
gangs and cybernetic enhancements. 
Technology has blurred the line between human and 
machine, with cyberware replacing body parts to 
enhance strength, vision, or hacking abilities. 
Players take on the role of V, a mercenary 
entangled with a mysterious implant housing 
the digital consciousness of the legendary rocker 
Johnny Silverhand, navigating themes of identity, 
transhumanism, and freedom in a world where personal 
autonomy is constantly threatened by corporate 
control and the brutal realities of a fractured 
society.</body>

<h2>Pick your path</h2>
<img src="/Photos/choices.webp" alt="choices" id="choices">
<h3>Nomad route</h3> 
<p>
The Nomad life path starts far from the chaotic heart of Night City, 
in the vast Badlands outside the city limits. 
As a Nomad, V is part of a tight-knit clan that values 
freedom and survival in the harsh desert environment. 
This route offers a unique outsider’s perspective on 
Night City, where V initially struggles with the city’s 
dense web of corruption and violence. Early on, Nomad V 
has special dialogue options that reflect their distrust 
of the city and its corporate overlords. The Nomad route 
also grants access to exclusive missions and contacts 
in the Badlands, and the player can often use the clan’s 
network for help or resources. This background brings a 
rugged, independent vibe to V’s story, 
emphasizing themes of loyalty and belonging.

<h3>Corpo route</h3>
<p>The Corpo path begins in the ruthless corporate towers of Arasaka, 
where betrayal and manipulation are as common as morning coffee. 
Starting here means you’ve already tasted power, ambition, 
and the toxic politics of the upper class. When you fall from that world, 
you bring with you a sharp awareness of how corporations operate—knowledge of 
strategy, backstabbing, and corporate doublespeak. The choices tied to this path often give you 
leverage when dealing with executives, politicians, and fixers, as you understand their 
motives better than most. This life path paints your character as someone who has been burned by the 
system but still knows how to weaponize its rules to survive.
