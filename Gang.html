<h2>6 Street</h2>     
The 6th Street Gang in Cyberpunk 2077 began
as a vigilante group formed by ex-military 
veterans after the devastation of the 4th 
Corporate War. Disillusioned with the chaos 
and abandonment left by the megacorps, they 
originally swore to protect their neighborhoods 
and provide the security the authorities failed 
to deliver. Over time, however, their ideals 
corroded. What started as a community defense f
orce gradually twisted into a ruthless gang, 
exploiting the very people they once swore to 
protect. Today, 6th Street still claims the mantle 
of guardianship, but their methods—extortion, intimidation, 
and violence—reveal how far they’ve strayed from their noble roots.
